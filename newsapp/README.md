# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

Welcome to this React project! This guide will help you get started and understand the available scripts and features provided by Create React App.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can use the following scripts to manage the application:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. It will automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will trigger a live reload, so you can see the updates instantly.

### `npm test`

Use this command to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. It will continuously monitor your test files for changes and rerun the tests automatically. For more information on writing tests, refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production and generates optimized files in the `build` folder. The output includes minified and hashed filenames for better performance and caching. Your application will be ready to be deployed after running this command.

### Customizing Configuration

If you find yourself needing to customize the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can use the `eject` command. However, keep in mind that this operation is irreversible, so use it with caution. By ejecting, you gain full control over configuration files and dependencies, but you will no longer receive updates from Create React App.
